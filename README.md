# Browser Calls - Rails
[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/browser-calls-rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/browser-calls-rails)

> We are currently in the process of updating this sample template. If you are encountering any issues with the sample, please open an issue at [github.com/twilio-labs/code-exchange/issues](https://github.com/twilio-labs/code-exchange/issues) and we'll try to help you.

Learn how to use [Twilio Client](https://www.twilio.com/client) to make browser-to-phone and browser-to-browser calls with ease. The unsatisfied customers of the Birchwood Bicycle Polo Co. need your help!

[Read the full tutorial here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/browser-calls/ruby/rails)!

## Quickstart

### Create a TwiML App

This project is configured to use a **TwiML App**, which allows us to easily set the voice URLs for all Twilio phone numbers we purchase in this app.

Create a new TwiML app at https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/dev-tools/twiml-apps and use its `Sid` as the `TWIML_APPLICATION_SID` environment variable wherever you run this app.

![Creating a TwiML App](http://howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/call-tracking-twiml-app.gif)

See the end of the "Local development" section for details on the exact URL to use in your TwiML app.

### Local development

This project is built using the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web framework. It runs on Ruby 2.3.1.

1. First clone this repository and `cd` into it:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:TwilioDevEd/browser-calls-rails.git
   cd browser-calls-rails
   ```

1. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   $ bundle
   ```

1. Copy the sample configuration file and edit it to match your configuration

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

   You can find your `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` in your
   [Twilio Account Settings](https://www.twilio.com/console).
   You will also need a `TWILIO_NUMBER`, which you may find [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming).

   Run `source .env` to export the environment variables

1. Create database and run migrations

   _Make sure you have installed [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/). If on
   a Mac, I recommend [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com)_.

   ```bash
   $ bundle exec rake db:setup
   ```

1. Make sure the tests succeed
   ```bash
   $ bundle exec rspec
   ```

1. Run the server

   ```bash
   $ bundle exec rails s
   ```

1. Expose your application to the wider internet using [ngrok](http://ngrok.com). This step
   is important because the application won't work as expected if you run it through
   localhost.

   ```bash
   $ ngrok http 3000
   ```

   Once you have started ngrok, update your [TwiML app's](#create-a-twiml-app) voice URL setting to use
   your ngrok hostname, so it will look something like this:

   ```
   http://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/call/connect
   ```

   You can read [this blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html)
   for more details on how to use ngrok.
